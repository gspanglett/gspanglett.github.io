# Welcome

**Welcome to all visitors**, this is the central home page for gspanglett's projects.

My first project is a set of platform-independent files that modify MS Word's built-in citation and bibliograpy functionality to include Canadian law objects and styling (McGill Style Guide, 9th ed).  Check out the source code or download the Windows or Mac installation packages here: [McGill-compliant MS Word Addon][word-addon] 

[word-addon]:   https://github.com/gspanglett/McGillBibliographyStylesheet

Details on Zotero CSL stylesheet to follow.

Gareth.
