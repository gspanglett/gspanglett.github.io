My name is Gareth Spanglett.  I am a full-time IT manager/specialist in Kanata, ON and a part-time, first-year law student at the University of Ottawa.

I am interested in developing, documenting and promoting "open source law" - bringing the open source philosophy to legal tech in particular, and to the legal profession in general.

The goal is to provide tools that reduce the time required in the day-to-day administration of the law.  The hope is that it reduces the time and cost to those who can least afford it.

If you are interested in open sourcing the law, feel free to drop me a line:  

gspanglett@gmail.com or gspan042@uottawa.ca

More to follow as this project progresses.  

Gareth.
